# (=´∀`)人(´∀‘=) Constant Constants

Netlify isn't going to send us on our Build Plugins journey empty-handed. This isn't an episode of [Survivorman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770659/). Netlify provides us with accoutrements called [`constants`]. We can pass these constants as an object or individually into our events. Here's what we have to work with:

* `CONFIG_PATH`: the path to the project's Netlify configuration file
* `PUBLISH_DIR`: the directory the user lists to publish their project from
* `BUILD_DIR`: the directory that contains the files and assets generated by the build
* `FUNCTIONS_DIST`: the directory where built [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=what-plugin-2-tzm&utm_campaign=devex) & serverless function are placed before deployment. Its value is always defined, but the target might not have been created yet.
* `FUNCTIONS_SRC`: the directory where function source code lives. `undefined` if not specified by the user.
* `EDGE_HANDLERS_SRC`: the directory where Edge Handlers source code lives. `undefined` if no `edge-handlers` directory exists in the base directory and if not specified in `netlify.toml`.
* `IS_LOCAL`: boolean indicating whether the build was [run locally](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#run-builds-locally) or on Netlify
* `NETLIFY_BUILD_VERSION`: version of Netlify Build as a `major.minor.patch` string
* `SITE_ID`: the project's [Netlify site ID](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=what-plugin-2-tzm&utm_campaign=devex#link-with-an-environment-variable)

Let's go ahead and add some constants to our code in the `index.js` file.

```js
...
onPostBuild: ({ constants }) => {
  console.log( 'onPostBuild: I run _after_ build commands are executed ✅');
  console.log('Here are some other things I know thanks to constants:');
  console.log(constants);
...
```

> 🐙 this would be a good time to commit code

If we run `ntl build` now we'll see all the constants and their values for our test project. Let's all head over to the terminal and see what we get.

> In another plugin I built, [Brand Guardian](https://github.com/tzmanics/netlify-plugin-brand-guardian), I use the `PUBLISH_DIR` to get the route to all project's HTML files and check for spelling errors of uniquely spelled brand words.

Now that we have all these tools that broaden the horizon of Build Plugin ideas (that I'm sure you're just brimming with by now) let's dig into some utilities.
