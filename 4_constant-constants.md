# (=Â´âˆ€`)äºº(Â´âˆ€â€˜=) Constant Constants

Netlify isn't going to send us on our Build Plugins journey empty-handed. This isn't an episode of [Survivorman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770659/). Netlify provides us with accoutrements called [`constants`]. Just like inputs we can pass these constants as an object or individually into our events. Here's what we have to work with:

* `CONFIG_PATH`: the path to the project's Netlify configuration file
* `PUBLISH_DIR`: the directory the user lists to publish their project from
* `BUILD_DIR`: the directory that contains the files and assets generated by the build
* `FUNCTIONS_DIST`: the directory of [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=what-plugin-2-tzm&utm_campaign=devex) source code
* `CACHE_DIR`: where the project's cache will live
* `IS_LOCAL`: a boolean signifying if the build is local or not
* `SITE_ID`: the project's [Netlify site ID](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=what-plugin-2-tzm&utm_campaign=devex#link-with-an-environment-variable)

Let's go ahead and add some constants to our code in the `index.js` file.

```js
...
onPostBuild: ({ constants }) => {
  console.log( 'onPostBuild: I run _after_ build commands are executed âœ…');
  console.log('Here are some other things I know thanks to constants:');
  console.log(constants);
...
```

If we run `ntl build` now we'll see all the constants and their values for our test project.

These logs are from the deployed version of the test project. The `SITE_ID` has been edited because it's sensititve information and not everyone out there is as nice as you ðŸ˜˜. The other values are the true, unedited information. We can access this individual information for each project that uses our plugin. In another plugin I built, [Brand Guardian](https://github.com/tzmanics/netlify-plugin-brand-guardian), I use the `PUBLISH_DIR` to get the route to all project's HTML files and check for spelling errors of uniquely spelled brand words.

Now that we have all these tools that broaden the horizon of Build Plugin ideas that I'm sure you're just brimming with by now, let's dig into some utilities.
